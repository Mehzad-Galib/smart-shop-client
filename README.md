In this live site, there are some default food items shown in the home page. An user can order any of the one item by clicking the 'Buy now' button. The user should be logged in. If he logged in successfully, he can ensure the purchase by 'place order' button. His order info will be stored in the "orders" section. There is an "Admin" panel, where the admin of the page can add or remove products form the database. 

For maintaining the database, MongoDB and Node.js has been used.
